This project uses Java to interact with the user to interact with CTA data. This app is supposed to allow the user to create a new CTA Station, entering exact locations and which type of train runs through it. It also allows them to modify or remove a station, and search an existing station by searching the name and calculating the nearest location determined by latitude and longitude.
This app uses lists, polymorphism, inheritance and recursion to perform such tasks, and uses the given Excel sheet with the CTA information to perform the tasks above.
